Simple Arduino DCF77 Decoder
============================

This is a simple decoder for the German [DCF77](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCF77)
time signal for the Arduino. There are already several DCF77 decoders out there
for the Arduino.
[But I wanted to do one on my own](http://photron.blogspot.de/2014/06/arduino-dcf77.html).

Quite a while later I came around and build an actual
[clock](https://github.com/photron/arduino-clock) out of it and decided
to put it on GitHub and here it is.
